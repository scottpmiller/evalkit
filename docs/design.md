# evalcore - design overview

evalcore is a **consumer-agnostic** evaluation engine. It scores a candidate
against a baseline over a fixed dataset, applies guardrails plus one headline
win metric, and produces a gate verdict. It knows nothing about any particular
system under test; a *consumer* supplies the system-specific pieces as data and
small plug-ins.

This doc records the design: where the engine/consumer boundary sits, the core
domain model, and how results are stored. For hands-on usage see the top-level
`README.md` and the worked example under `examples/quickstart/`.

---

## 1. The boundary

The whole design rests on one line: **what the engine owns vs. what a consumer
owns.** If that boundary is clean, onboarding a second system is "write an
adapter + datasets + graders config," not "fork the framework." If it leaks,
every new consumer reopens the core.

This shape is well-trodden - promptfoo, OpenAI Evals, Braintrust, and LangSmith
all converge on the same pipeline (case -> target -> graders -> comparison ->
gate). evalcore is not inventing the abstraction; it is drawing the line so the
engine stays reusable across unrelated systems.

## 2. Generic vs. consumer-specific

| Concern | **Engine** | **Consumer** |
|---|---|---|
| Case / suite schema + loading | yes | uses it |
| Runner: sampling (N), concurrency, live/replay modes | yes | picks mode/config |
| Target-adapter protocol + built-ins (HTTP, replay) | yes | configures/extends |
| Variant model (baseline vs candidate knobs) | yes opaque dict | defines its knobs |
| Grader protocol + registry | yes | registers its graders |
| Generic graders: deterministic, LLM-judge, classification, numeric | yes | configures + writes custom |
| Comparison / regression engine (win metric, guardrails) | yes | sets thresholds |
| Gate decision (comparison -> pass/warn/fail) | yes | sets policy |
| Results store + row schema / outbox | yes | gets a `project` namespace |
| Reporters (Markdown / HTML) | yes | gets them free |
| Datasets (cases + labels) | no | yes owns |
| Judge **rubrics** | no | yes owns |
| Custom graders / adapters | no | yes owns |
| Thresholds / guardrail config | no | yes owns |
| Which suite runs on which change trigger | no | yes owns |

Everything in the left column is consumer-agnostic. The right column is what a
new team writes.

## 3. Core domain model

Eight concepts, none of which mention any particular system:

- **Suite** - a named eval belonging to a `project` (e.g. `my-service/reply`).
  The unit of versioning and gating.
- **Case** - `{ id, input, expected?, labels? }`. `input` and `expected` are
  **opaque blobs** the engine never interprets - only the adapter and graders
  do. This is what keeps the core generic.
- **Variant** - the thing being compared: a dict of knobs
  (`{model, prompt_version, ...}`). The engine treats it as opaque; the adapter
  understands it. "Baseline" and "candidate" are two variants.
- **Target adapter** - `invoke(case, variant) -> Output`. The one seam to the
  system under test. The built-in **HTTP adapter** (POST a templated body, read
  a response) covers most request/response APIs; the **replay adapter** returns
  recorded outputs so the whole pipeline runs offline. Consumers register their
  own for anything else.
- **Grader** - `grade(case, output) -> [Score]` where
  `Score = {metric, value, passed?, detail}`. Registry-based; tiered
  (deterministic -> numeric -> classification -> LLM judge).
- **Run** - execute `suite × variant` over all cases × N samples -> outputs +
  scores, persisted as a `RunResult`.
- **Scorecard** - aggregated scores for one run (mean/stdev per metric).
- **Comparison + Gate** - candidate scorecard vs baseline -> deltas, guardrail
  checks, win metric -> `pass | warn | fail`.

```python
class TargetAdapter(typing.Protocol):
    async def invoke(self, case: Case, variant: Variant) -> Output: ...

class Grader(typing.Protocol):
    name: str
    def grade(self, case: Case, output: Output) -> list[Score]: ...  # may be async
```

Two protocols (plus an `AggregateGrader` variant for whole-run metrics) are the
entire extension surface. Everything else is engine.

## 4. Where it lives - a library, not a central service

A tempting wrong turn is a central "eval service" that calls out to every
team's system. That inverts the dependency (the platform needs network + auth
into every consumer's environment) and becomes a bottleneck. Instead:

- **evalcore is a library.** It runs **in the consumer's CI**, right next to the
  system under test, where the network path and the service's own auth already
  exist. Runner, adapters, graders, and the comparison engine all ship here.
- **An optional shared results store is the only central component** - a column
  store holding multi-tenant scorecards keyed by `project`/`suite`, plus a
  dashboard for trend-over-time. No business logic, just storage + views.

So "the platform" = a library + (optionally) a shared store + conventions.
Coupling stays low; each consumer owns its runs.

## 5. The consumer contract

A consumer adds an eval tree (its own repo, or a directory like
`examples/quickstart/`) and implements exactly four things:

1. **Adapter config** - usually just declare the built-in HTTP adapter:
   endpoint, how to build the request body from `case.input`, how to extract
   `Output` fields from the response, auth, and the **variant knobs**.
2. **Datasets** - versioned `cases/*.yaml` with `input` + optional
   `expected`/`labels`.
3. **Graders** - pick generic ones (deterministic checks, numeric, judge with
   rubric, classification) + register any custom graders; supply judge rubrics.
4. **Suite + threshold config** - guardrail metrics, win metric + dead band,
   N samples, which triggers run which suite.

The engine supplies runner, comparison, gate, store, reporters, and the CLI.
That ratio - four data files vs. a whole engine - is the genericity test: if
onboarding a consumer ever requires editing `src/evalcore/`, that's an
abstraction leak to fix at the seam, not a fork.

## 6. Results store & outbox

Scorecards and comparisons serialize to JSON for CI artifacts and local files.
For trend tracking, results can land in a column store (e.g. ClickHouse) keyed
by `project`/`suite`. Rather than couple the engine to any particular database
driver, `store.JsonlOutboxExporter` flattens a run into a stable, flat row
shape and writes JSONL to an **outbox** a separate shipper drains:

- one **metric** row per scorecard metric (`metric, value, stdev, metric_kind,
  n`), and
- one **per-case score** row (`run_id, case_id, sample_idx, grader, metric,
  value, passed, detail`).

Both repeat the full reproducibility key so a multi-tenant trend table can
filter/group on any dimension without joins. The rows use a no-`Nullable`
convention that maps cleanly onto a column store (a missing value is the
sentinel pair `(value=0, has_value=false)`; `passed` is the tri-state string
`'true'|'false'|'null'`). Swap the exporter for a real database client without
touching the runner or any consumer.

## 7. Provenance

Every scorecard (and every outbox row) carries the full reproducibility key:
`project, suite, variant, dataset_version, model_id, prompt_version,
judge_version, revision, suite_hash, dataset_hash, mode, created_at`.

The declared versions state *intent*; the engine-computed content hashes prove
it. `suite_hash` digests the raw suite file; `dataset_hash` digests the loaded
cases (order- and formatting-independent). Two runs whose hashes match
evaluated the same config over the same data - so if a metric moved, the system
under test moved. If a hash changed, the eval itself changed and the comparison
is apples-to-oranges: re-baseline. `revision` ties a run to whatever provenance
scheme the consumer uses (commit SHA, image digest, release label); the engine
never interprets it.
